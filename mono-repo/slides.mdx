# What are mono repos

A Monorepository is an architectural concept, which basically contains all the meaning in its title.

In simple terms.

All the code that the project needs lives in one place


---
# What mono repos aren't
- Monoliths
- Poly repo
- They are about sharing code and separating areas of concerns
- They aren't a place to build applications that couples modules together
- They don't store packages in a global scope (ie not installing packages in root dir)
- A place to duplicate code
---
# Pros mono repos

## Pros
- One place to store all configs and tests
- Easier dependency management
- Re-use code with shared packages while still keeping them isolated
- Easy to share packages in the same project and enforce hard boundaries

---
# Cons mono repos
- Poor Git performance when working on large-scale projects
- Large node_modules folder and installing can take longer
- Large number of open Pull requests on one repo

---
# Why should we use them at Voyage

- Decouple the presentation layer of code from the application code
- Increase code sharing across projects.
- Allows for re-uses of modules in other projects
- Can publish and version packages
---

# What we have learnt about mono repos so far
- Deployments are harder
- Conceptually understanding takes thought
- Patch package doesn't work well
- Package names can conflict with npm packages

Notes: Deployment scripts have to target the "scope" they want to run the code for

# Thats it
